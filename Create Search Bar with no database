Yes, there are alternative ways to retrieve HTML articles by tags and keywords without using a database. One common approach is to store the metadata for your articles in XML or JSON format and use a library or tool to parse the data and extract the relevant information. Here's an overview of how you could implement this approach:

1) Store article metadata in XML or JSON: You can create an XML or JSON file for each article that contains metadata such as the article title, tags, and content. The file should be structured in a way that makes it easy to extract the metadata using code.
Example XML file for an article:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<article>
  <title>How to Stay Healthy</title>
  <tags>
    <tag>health</tag>
    <tag>fitness</tag>
    <tag>nutrition</tag>
  </tags>
  <content>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. ...</p>
  </content>
</article>

2) Parse the XML or JSON files using code: You can use a library or tool to parse the XML or JSON files and extract the metadata for each article. There are many libraries and tools available for parsing XML and JSON in various programming languages.
Example PHP code for parsing an XML file:

<?php
// Load the XML file
$xml = simplexml_load_file('article.xml');

// Get the article title and tags
$title = (string) $xml->title;
$tags = array();
foreach ($xml->tags->tag as $tag) {
  $tags[] = (string) $tag;
}

// Get the article content
$content = (string) $xml->content;
?>

3) Search for articles based on tags and keywords: Once you have parsed the metadata for each article, you can search through the articles based on tags and keywords using code. You can use techniques such as regular expressions or string matching to search through the article titles and tags.
Example PHP code for searching for articles by tag:

<?php
// Loop through all the articles
foreach ($articles as $article) {
  // Check if the article has the desired tag
  if (in_array('health', $article['tags'])) {
    // Display the article title and content
    echo '<h2>' . $article['title'] . '</h2>';
    echo $article['content'];
  }
}
?>

Example PHP code for searching for articles by keyword:

<?php
// Loop through all the articles
foreach ($articles as $article) {
  // Check if the article title contains the desired keyword
  if (strpos($article['title'], 'healthy') !== false) {
    // Display the article title and content
    echo '<h2>' . $article['title'] . '</h2>';
    echo $article['content'];
  }
}
?>

Note that this approach may not be as scalable or efficient as using a database, especially if you have a large number of articles. However, it can be a good option if you have a small number of articles and don't want to set up a database.

If you don't know which tag or keyword the reader will use to search for your articles, you can leave the search field blank or provide some suggestions for tags or keywords that the reader might be interested in.

In the case of a blank search field, you can modify the SQL query to retrieve all articles without filtering by any specific tags or keywords, like this:
_____________________________________

SELECT * FROM articles
_____________________________________

This SQL query would retrieve all articles in your database or XML/JSON file.

Alternatively, you can provide some suggestions for tags or keywords that the reader might be interested in, such as a list of popular tags or a search bar that autocompletes suggestions as the reader types. This can help the reader discover new articles and narrow down their search based on their interests.

<form action="search.php" method="get">
  <input type="text" name="q" placeholder="Search by keyword or tag...">
  <datalist id="suggestions">
    <option value="health">
    <option value="fitness">
    <option value="nutrition">
    <!-- Add more options as needed -->
  </datalist>
  <button type="submit">Search</button>
</form>

The datalist element provides a list of suggestions that appear as the reader types into the search bar. You can modify the suggestions to match the tags or keywords for your articles.
